# Introduction
A collection of cheatsheets of 
- a **data-mining** researcher who
  - write code with **Python**
  - in **neovim**
  - and enjoys **DevOps** tricks
Part of the cheatsheets which can be reguarded as a part of configurations/dot-files & auto-deployment are moved to [deploy](https://github.com/you-n-g/deploy)


# Runnable cheatsheets!
To make the most of cheatsheets, I try to make them RUNNALBLE!


Currently, not all cheatsheets are runnable. We are continouesly trying to complete it. Your PR is also welcome!


# Catalog principle
The cheatsheests are categorized by scenarios/intentions.
- Because cheatsheets are often seeked when we are focusing on a specific scenario, putting them together will improve the *rate of hit cheatsheets*

Explanations for folders for scenarios/intentions.
- ML: machine learning & data mining.
- app: cheatsheets for specific applications.
- SA: system administration. A lot of DevOps tricks snippets will be placed here
    - What's the boundary bettween APP and SA? (some tools in for SA are also some appps)
        - Small applications and tools which is only (or maininly) for helping the system run better or performing some regular maintanance tasks will be included in SA
        - Otherwise, they will be included in the APPs
- language: some cheatsheets for built-in languages, e.g. syntactic sugar, profiling, debugging.
- tools: Some tools which are used in daily coding workflow.
