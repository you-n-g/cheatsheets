# Yes, you can achieve this requirement using Python's subprocess module with timeout. The main process can wait (join) for 10 seconds and continue even if the subprocess is still running (or stuck in D state). The subprocess will remain as a zombie/D-state in the background unless manually cleaned up. Example code:
import subprocess, time
p = subprocess.Popen("ls /home ; sleep 3 ; ls /mnt/test/", stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True)
wait_time = 10
try:
    p.wait(timeout=wait_time)  # Wait for 10 seconds
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    print("Main process done waiting after 10 seconds. Subprocess may still be running (or in D state).")

# Get the stdout, stderr, and exit code of the subprocess if possible
try:
    out, err = p.communicate(timeout=1)  # Try to collect output immediately after wait
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    out, err = None, None  # Unable to collect output if child still running
exit_code = p.returncode
print("stdout:", out)  # TODO: for D state process, stdout is None
print("stderr:", err)
print("exit code:", exit_code)
